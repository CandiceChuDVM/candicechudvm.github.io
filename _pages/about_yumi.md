### Yumi Chang, DVM
#### BIMS Master's student


Hi! I’m Yumi! My name might sound Japanese, but it’s actually a fun twist on my childhood Mandarin name—I’m from Taiwan! I earned my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from [National Chung Hsing University](https://www.nchu.edu.tw/en-index), and I’m currently diving into the exciting worlds of pathology and artificial intelligence. I’m also a proud dog mom to a sweet, people-loving mixed-breed girl. When I’m not exploring science or chasing new ideas, you’ll find me in the kitchen, cooking up something delicious and fully enjoying the process from start to finish.

### Franklin Kao
#### Student research assstant

Hi, I am Franklin. Originally from Taiwan, I hold a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry with a minor in Economics from National Taiwan University. During my time in the chemistry lab, working with data sparked a deeper interest in data and computer science. Currently, I’m working as a student assistant on projects involving Large Language Models and Machine Learning. Outside of academics, my interests lean toward the quieter side, like learning Japanese, playing board games and piano. Recently, I’ve been getting into cooking and trying to improve my skills in the kitchen.
